# Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Mountain Names

## Task Overview
In this project, we developed a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify mountain names within text. The task involved dataset creation, model selection, training/fine-tuning, and preparing demo code to showcase the model's inference capabilities. The solution is implemented in Python 3, with all relevant code and files provided in this repository.
