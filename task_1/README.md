# Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Mountain Names

## Task Overview
In this project, we developed a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify mountain names within text. The task involved dataset creation, model selection, training/fine-tuning, and preparing demo code to showcase the model's inference capabilities. The solution is implemented in Python 3, with all relevant code and files provided in this repository.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.10+.

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mountain-names-ner.git
   cd mountain-names-ner
   
   
2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Code
**Training Script:**
To train or fine-tune the NER model, run the following script:
```bash
python training.py
```

**Inference Script:**
To run the inference on a given sentence, use:
```bash
python inference.py
```

**Demo Jupyter Notebook:**
You can run the Jupyter notebook to see the entire process from dataset preparation to inference:
```bash
jupyter notebook demo_notebook.ipynb
```
