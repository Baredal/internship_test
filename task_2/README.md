# Satellite Image Matcher with SIFT-LightGlue and LoFTR

Mmatching keypoints between satellite images using the LoFTR (Local Feature TRansformer) model and SIFT+LightGlue model. This project supports keypoint matching, inlier calculation, and visualization of matches.

## Features

- **Keypoint Matching**: Matches keypoints between two satellite images using the pre-trained models.
- **Fundamental Matrix Estimation**: Estimates the fundamental matrix using RANSAC and calculates inliers.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of matched keypoints and inliers between two images.

## Notes
To advance the installed models, you need to install them locally from the official repository. You will also need to download the dataset from the keg. That's why I attach a link to a laptop with the libraries and inferencom installed, results and visualizations of the algorithms. <br>
